  Recently, I have had trouble with studying and keeping up, which led me to stop and think.
  Am I satisfied with the pace I'm learning at. It was not more than 3 years ago, that I
  started developing an interest in Mathematics, and a little under a year for programming 
  and Computer Science. Keeping that in mind, I thought I'd be OK with how much I've accomplished
  in this year.
  But I am not. It is no secret, that I started out not long ago, with little experience and with a 
  lot of time *wasted*. I constantly felt regret about not having started my interests when I was younger.
  I really do want to become a scientist, a person who works on cutting-edge research, but I am constantly
  reminded that the most prominent people have had their passions even as teens. I used to think: "Okay, I just have
  to study everyday for 10 hours straigh!". But I didn't know there would be so much other issues and distractions
  to stop me from doing so. Even if I did not have problems with studying that much, the fact is that I wouldn't have
  learned more. And that is because I still don't know efficient ways of studying.

  That was the sad part of the post - now comes the inspiring!
  From here on, I set my goal of achieving what I want the most - to become a Computer Scientist/Mathematician/Good Coder.
  The goal I set sounds vague. But in its essence it really is a combination of the following few goals:

  * I want to improve myself and feel that intellectually I am not behind.  
    Learning new things gives me perspective in life, and makes me feel  
    secure and up-to-date.
  * I want to make scietific contributions, to know that I had a part in  
  	shaping the history of mankind, however miniscule it may seem.
  * I', of course, want to have *close encounters of the first kind* with technology
    and engineering.

  Computer Science (+ relevant background in Mathematic) is the intersection of my goals.

  Long story short, I am starting this blog with a manifesto:

  	 I will do my best to develop and grow as an individual
  	 and in this process help further humanity's progress towards  
  	 a better future!
