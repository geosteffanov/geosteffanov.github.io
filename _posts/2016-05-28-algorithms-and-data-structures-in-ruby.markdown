## _**Time for some fun and coding!**_

Brief exposition:  
During my first semester at Uni, I attended a course titled : 'Programming in Ruby'.
This is self-explanatory.  
I really would like to write a post about it in the future, but right now this post has a different theme.
There I  
learned many things, and I am glad I attended it. Recently, however, I haven't
made any progress in Ruby -  
in spite of the fact that it's a beautiful language.
Now I found a perfect exercise to keep me fluid in Ruby,  
and to learn more useful things.

I announce...

# _**Project Ruby-AlgoStruct**_

With the help of Ruby's pleasing and 'carefree' syntax I will implement most of the algorithms and
data structures in the book: 

_'Introduction to Algorithms'_



<!-- Time for some fun and insightful coding! During my first semester at Uni, I went through
a sort of 'introductory' course called 'Programming in Ruby'. You guessed it - it was
about programming in Ruby. I learned a lot of useful stuff - it was there that for the first
time I started coding something more than mere snippets for summing an array, or finding 
some divisor of some number. I learned good practice and I learned that testing is essential
if you are to create large programs (large on a newbie scale, let alone on industrial).

From what I've experienced Ruby is great at these things: 

* It is very high level, which always makes for a more pleasant and productive time spent coding.  
	  this is especially important for people who are new to any sort of coding. I as a fresher, was
	  very excited every time I loaded up my program - with a few lines of code I could immediately  
	  see results. In other languages, there is additional set-up before you can produce the same  
	  programs - although there are libraries that help, they add additional information that might not
	  be essential for a newbie to know at that moment. 

* Since its dynamically typed and object-oriented, things like polymorphism, abstractions are easily
	  implemented  for a better structured code. This allows you to freely implement algorithms on
	  objects, without being concerned of what essence they are. (Well apart from the 'essence' needed for  
	  the algorithms ofcourse)

* Ruby's syntax is minimalistic - when there's no need for brackets, parentheses and what not, then there's syntax  
	  that allows omission of such. It's natural that humans 'parse' words and sentences in natural languages faster,  
	  when they don't contain specific symbols. Everything that can be defined well with a word or a short abbreviation of it,
      so long as it is distinc and intuitive, is better read from a human than arbitrary symbols. This, naturally, makes for
	  a more readable code in Ruby - which is crucial in open-source and team projects. Not only that, but it can also show
	  potential employers a clearer picture of your code, sometimes being enough to convince them that you know what you're doing

However, Ruby also has some downsides and weaknesses - just like any other language out there. It is a result of basic logic. More on that *later*.
For example: 

* Ruby is very high level, dynamically typed. Now you're probably thinking: 
	_Didn't he just say those were good things?!_ Well, I did and they are - for the purpose I presented in the above point.
  However, for some people once they reach a certain level of abstraction, they feel uneasy and want to learn the lower leves,
  so they can be more versatile, when things fail to work as expected. Such was the case with me - I admit, I probably didn't really reach such a level of a abstracton, but nonetheless I felt the need to understand more of the basics. I was taking
  Ruby too much for granted.

<!-- bad things about ruby end here -->
<!-- Truthfully, even though I had nothing to compare it to, Ruby still felt like it brought something fresh and new to the table.
If I could describe how I felt and still to some extend feel about Ruby in one word I think it would be: _**sleek**_.

Sadly, since the beginning of the second semester I have had almost no interaction with this beautifully designed language.
This is partly because I had not enough time, and partly because I wanted to dedicate myself more on more 'low-level' things.

I realized, recently, however, that due to the expressiveness and conciseness of Ruby, I can use it to fill another gap of my
knowledge. For all the Discrete Mathematics and Computability I have learned, I haven't delved more into the specifics of 
algorithms and data structures - things that are the to programming as breathing is to humans.	With this in mind, I announce
my new project: Ruby-AlgoStruct
