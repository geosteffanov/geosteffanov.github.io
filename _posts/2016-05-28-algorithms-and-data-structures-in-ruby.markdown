## _**Time for some fun and coding!**_

Brief exposition:  
During my first semester at Uni, I attended a course titled : 'Programming in Ruby'.
This is self-explanatory.  
I really would like to write a post about it in the future, but right now this post has a different theme.
There I  
learned many things, and I am glad I attended it. Recently, however, I haven't
made any progress in Ruby -  
in spite of the fact that it's a beautiful language.
Now I found a perfect exercise to keep me fluid in Ruby,  
and to learn more useful things.

I announce...

# _**Project Ruby-AlgoStruct**_

With the help of Ruby's pleasing and 'carefree' syntax I will implement most of the algorithms and
data structures in the book: 

_'Introduction to Algorithms'_

$$ \|\alpha\| + {\beta}^i_2 $$
