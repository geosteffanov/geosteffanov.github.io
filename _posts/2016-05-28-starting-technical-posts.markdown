  It is about time that I began updating my blog regularly with more technical posts.  
  For posts about coding Markdown is generally sufficient with its support for code  
  snippets. However, I am planning on starting a series of Computer Science posts on  
  Automata and Languages, as a recap of what I learned this semester in Computability  
  Theory - therefore I will need to learn atleast a basic level of LaTeX.

  Thus, there may be some delay before I actually start posting - a necessary pause needed  
  for me to acquire the technical skills for TeX.
