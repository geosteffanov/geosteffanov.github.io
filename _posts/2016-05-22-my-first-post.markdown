Hello!

My name is Georgi Stefanov. Currently, May 2016, I am finishing my first year of studying Computer Science at Sofia
University, Bulgaria. My prime 'scientific' interest is Mathematics, but I am always keen on learning anything new.
Of course, I have many interests and hobbies, but my initial
intentions for this site is to store and reflect upon my progress as a student, to post blog-lectures _(although I am not sure what approach to use for this end)_, show snippets of my code, and discuss my views on CS topics.

So how did I start this site? Well, I am still a learner, but I followed through this easy course in [Codecademy][codecademy-webdeployment] which showed me how to deploy a webpage using GitHub Pages, combined with [Jekyll][jekyll-site]. There is much more for me to learn, and there will always be - but that's the fun part of it all!



If you have any suggestions for me and my blog, or you just want to contact me you can do so by e-mail: geosteffanov@gmail.com
